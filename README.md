This webpage lets users see a list of animals that the zoo owns and see various information about each animal including: Species, Name, Age, Diet, Location, Number of Caretakers, Sex, Animal Likes and Animal Dislikes. A user can also add new animals and edit existing animals.

## Setup

1. `$git clone https://github.com/madjacks12/solar-age`

## FurtherImplementation.
  In the future I would like to include"
  1. Ability to filter animals by more criteria such as diet, caretaker and species.
