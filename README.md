##Planning
  This app should include:
  1. Models for each animal with these parameters: Species, Name, Age, Diet, Location, Caretakers, Sex, Likes, Dislikes.
  2. A form for users to add new animals to the app.
  3. A dropdown menu that will filter animals by age. Either less than  or equal to 2 years old, or older than 2.
  4. A second form for users to edit details about an animal.

##FurtherImplementation.
  In the future I would like to include"
  1. Ability to filter animals by more criteria such as diet, caretaker and species.
  2. Generate Timestamps for when each animal was admitted.
